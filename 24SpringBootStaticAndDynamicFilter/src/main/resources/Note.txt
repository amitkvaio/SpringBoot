I'm sending a GET request to our users resource and I'm getting this response back.
Id, name, birthdate. Id, name, birthdate.
Let's say, I don't want birthday to come in my response. How do I do that?
That concept is called filtering.

Static Filtering
	Use Case:
		You want to permanently exclude some fields from JSON response
		@JsonIgnore — skips the field in JSON output.
		@JsonProperty — customizes the JSON property name.

		
Dynamic Filtering
****************
Sometimes for some requests I would want to send these two fields alone and for other requests I would want to send these two fields.

So, in specific requests I don’t want to send one. In specific request I don’t want to send field three.

How do we be able to do that?
****************************

That's basically where the concept of dynamic filtering comes. With dynamic filtering we cannot configure filtering directly on the bean.
we need to start configuring the filtering where they’re retrieving the values.
